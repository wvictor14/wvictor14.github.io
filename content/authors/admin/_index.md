I am a [PhD student in Professor Wendy Robinson's lab](https://robinsonresearch.ca/) at the University of British Columbia in the Genome Sciences and Technology program. My research interests include genomic analysis of genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data related to placental biology. Outside of my research, I enjoy rock climbing and taking care of my three-legged dog, [Sandy](blank).

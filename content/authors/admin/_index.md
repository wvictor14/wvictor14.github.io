A bioinformatics scientist working in on cell therapy at Sonoma Biotherapeutics
in San Francisco. Studied DNA methylation in context of pregnancy epigenetics
for my PhD at University of British Columbia. Due to start-up nature, I have 
diverse responsibilities and experience: analyzing in-house generated
immunological NGS datasets, utilizing public RNA/protein databases like HPA and
UniProt, developing R packages and web apps, and designing and implementing NGS
workflows and data engineering models.

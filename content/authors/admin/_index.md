I recently graduated with a PhD in Genome Sciences and Technology from UBC in Professor Wendy Robinson's [lab](https://robinsonresearch.ca/). I look for stories in genomic data. Right now, I am very interested in placental epigenomics and human development. See my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k_dOrEoAAAAJ&hl=en). I am passionate about genomic data analysis and visualization. Open to collaborations.

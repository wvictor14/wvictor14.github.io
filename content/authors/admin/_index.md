Hello! I am a [PhD student under Professor Wendy Robinson](https://robinsonresearch.ca/) at the University of British Columbia in the Genome Sciences and Technology program, where I explore my interests in human genomics under the domain of placental biology and perinatal development. I specialize in epigenetic (DNA methylation) analysis involving large populations.

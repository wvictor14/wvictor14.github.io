<p>After a fun 5 weeks, the second installment of the <strong>Pacific Boulder League (PBL)</strong> is nearing its end. Two Fridays ago (November 1st) was the Hive Finals for the 3 participating Hive gyms (Vancouver, North Shore, and the newly-opened Surrey location).</p>
<p>This year I participated as part of team Bishi Bashi with Yvonne and 3 others <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Being a big nerd, I decided to take a closer look at the competition scores, which were released on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/1809792565734658/posts/2463567067023868/">Hive’s Facebook page</a>.</p>

<h1>How the league works</h1>
<p>Pacific Boulder League is a friendly team-based bouldering competition that includes several participating gyms in Vancouver and nearby cities. Each gym holds their own competition for the first 3-5 weeks, where teams compete internally. Then the top teams from each gym goes to a grand finals event (Nov 20th) at Project Climbing Cloverdale.</p>
<p>We participated at the Hive, which owns 3 gyms that all participated. The Hive competition was organized like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teams must be <strong>4-5 members and co-ed</strong></li>
<li><strong>20 boulders</strong> are created each week for teams to climb on</li>
<li>Each climb is graded on a <strong>6-point “Hex” system</strong> that’s ordered numerically (1 hex boulders are easiest, 6 hex are hardest)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li>Each person adds up their <strong>hardest 5 boulders</strong> that they climbed</li>
<li>These <strong>added-up scores are then averaged by the total number of team members</strong> for a team’s weekly score</li>
<li>Final rankings are determined by the cumulative total over all weeks</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s more relevant and interesting for us Hive climbers what the equivalent hex grade that each team is climbing at. Therefore, when possible I calculated the <em>Average Hex Score</em> for each team, which is the <em>Weekly PBL score</em> divided by the <em>total number of boulders climbed</em> (which is 5).</p>
<p>The Hex Grading System is unique to the Hive gyms (many climbing gyms use there own system nowadays). Here is how the hex grades translate to the more standard V-grade system:</p>

<div id="versus-2018" class="section level1">
<h1>2019 versus 2018</h1>
<p>Last year, Yvonne (also a big nerd) kept track of all the team’s scores from the Vancouver location. One thing was clearly different from last year: <strong>attendance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There were 39 teams across all three gyms this year, compared to 19 teams from last year.</strong> That’s more than double the attendance!</p>
<p>Most of this increase in number of teams occured in the Vancouver gym (14 -&gt; 24). Surrey actually had more teams participating than North Shore (8 versus 7), which is surprising, given that Surrey only opened earlier this year.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-11-14-pacific-boulder-league-2019_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Since there was an increase in number of teams from last year, I wondered if this increase was due to more interest in climbing and participation among <strong>beginner</strong> climbers. This would make sense, because a large proportion of the increase in teams occured at the new Surrey location (<em>new gyms = new climbers?</em>).</p>
<p><strong>To determine if the increase in PBL attendance from 2018 to 2019 were due to beginner climbers joining,</strong> I looked at if teams from 2018 scored higher than 2019 teams <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The plot below is a <em>density</em> plot of weekly team scores, for each gym, and for each year. The height of the <em>peaks</em> is proportional to how many teams reported that score (x-axis).</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-11-14-pacific-boulder-league-2019_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><strong>Did teams perform better this year compared to last?</strong></p>
<p>On average, yes… teams this year reported lower scores (average 2019 weekly hex score = 3.09) compared to last year (3.23), <strong>but this decrease in performance was not statistically significant (p&lt;0.05).</strong></p>
<p>So, <strong>the increase in attendance this year was not because of mainly new climbers deciding to join. Teams that joined this year consisted of climbers with varied skill level.</strong></p>
<p><em>Then, why did attendance increase so dramatically this year?</em> One explanation could be that advertisement for PBL was much better at the Hive this year. In general, I’ve noticed the Hive Vancouver has been really on top of their events chalkboard and email news letters. Increase in attendance could also be a sign that last year’s season was a great success.</p>
</div>
<div id="teams-that-missed-weeks" class="section level1">
<h1>Teams that missed weeks</h1>
<p>With any kind of team event that requires regular attendance over a long period of time, there will be challenges in coordinating meeting times with team members. Fortunately, the <a href="https://hiveclimbing.com/events/">PBL rules</a> try to accomodate teams when there are weeks where some members are unable to attend:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Teams must climb together once a week, but can pick any day/time</li>
<li>A maximum of one team member can be absent for a given week, without any penalization on their scores</li>
</ol>
However, even with these accomodations, <strong>some teams did not participate every week:</strong>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-5"></span>
<img src="/post/2019-11-14-pacific-boulder-league-2019_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" alt="Note: I interpret that when a team did not hand in their score, they simply were unable to get enough team members to meet at the same time that week." width="624" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1: Note: I interpret that when a team did not hand in their score, they simply were unable to get enough team members to meet at the same time that week.
</p>
</div>
<p>One week stands out in the above: <strong>For the Hive finals week, 13 out of 39 teams (33%) teams did not hand in their score card</strong>. This is much lower than the week 1-5 average attendance (&gt;95%). This significant drop in attendance is likely because many participants were simply not free at the peculiar time of the Hive Finals event, which was held on a Friday, at 6PM<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Some other observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team <em>Vol. U &amp; Me</em> dropped out after the first week</li>
<li><em>Veloci-rock-tors</em> and <em>One Hex Flex</em> were the only other teams that missed non-finals weeks.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="were-some-weeks-harder-than-others" class="section level1 tabset">
<h1>Were some weeks harder than others?</h1>
<p>I definitely thought the second and third week of PBL was really easy for our team, most of us got all 3 five hexes and a couple of us got one of the six hexes. I wonder if other teams felt the same?</p>
<p>To determine if some weeks were harder than others, I calculated each team’s weekly performance relative to their overall performance across all weeks. For each week, here are the percentage of teams that scored better than their overall average performance:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-11-14-pacific-boulder-league-2019_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>If more teams performed better than average for a given week, that means that the boulders that were set that week were easier. If more teams performed worse, then boulders were harder that week.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The first week’s problems were hard!</strong> All gyms had more teams performing relatively worse than average (% of teams performing better than average was &lt; 30%).</li>
<li>At Vancouver, the 3rd and 4th week were easier than usual - 78 and 91% of teams performed better than average for those weeks, respectively.</li>
<li>At Surrey, the first two weeks were harder than the last 3 weeks (25-38% vs 62-75%).</li>
<li>At North Shore, the first and last weeks were harder than the middle 3 (29% vs 57%).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If would be interesting to further break this down by grade.</strong> Our team found week 2 easy, but only 35% of Vancouver teams performed better than their average that week. This is likely because our team climbed at a different grade range than most other teams. Problems that we were trying that week might have been easier, but at the same time, problems in other grade ranges could have been much harder.</p>
<p><strong>Here (below plot) is a closer look at all teams relative weekly performance.</strong> The above percentages were calculated by simply counting the number of teams on either side of the 0 line. But with the below graph, we can see how much each team performed better/worst than their average, in terms of hex points. We can see that the performance almost never deviates that dramatically from the average (0 line).</p>
<p><strong>But! Some teams had very dramatic swings in performance</strong>. For example, team <em>Generic Bouldering Team Name</em>, performed much worse in their 5th week. This is because this team had some members that suffered from injuries and had to drop out unfortunately.</p>

<h1>How did teams compare before and after finals</h1>
<p>The PBL Hive Finals had an interesting format, where scores for that week counted double and special <em>team problems</em> for bonus points were created. Scores from finals were then added on to the previous 5 weeks of scores to determine a final ranking/placement. The idea with these special rules was to allow teams an opportunity to drastically improve their ranking by performing better at finals than any other week.</p>
<p><strong>Did the ranking (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd) of teams significantly change after finals?</strong></p>

<p>There’s some really interesting things going on here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The top 3 teams were really consistently in the lead the entire competition</li>
<li>There’s some more variation in rankings in the top 4-10 teams:
<ul>
<li>Teams <em>Jako</em> and <em>Crimp My Ride</em> had rough starts (bottom 60%) but dramatically overtook other teams by the end of the competition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Generic Bouldering Team Name</em> started off in 2nd place, was in 5th place before finals, and then ended up placing 17th after finals.</li>
<li><em>Jugs Not Drugs</em> started in 34th position (4th last), crawled to 26th position before finals, and ended up in 19th after finals.</li>
<li>Many other teams (<em>Soft Rock, Aaron Lacovitti, Our Beta is no-guchi, One Hex Flex</em>) seemed to be doing well before finals, before dropping dramatically post-finals. These were likely teams that did not participate in the finals.</li>
<li><strong>Teams that ended up placing in the middle (ranks 21-30), often showed dramatic changes in both directions to their ranking after the final.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Many teams did in fact improve their ranking after finals, but many teams also dropped rankings too. Personally, I really liked <em>most</em><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> the format of the finals. I think giving teams a chance to catch up makes it more interesting. It was just unfortunate timing for many.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Overall, this PBL season has been a lot of fun. I was really impressed with the turnout this year, and happy that our team did so well. I hope to see the Hive continuing thinking about how to improve PBL, especially since it seems that interest has grown significantly from last year.</p>

After a fun month and a half, the second season of the **Pacific Boulder League (PBL)** has ended. Three Fridays ago (November 1st) was the Hive Finals for the 3 participating Hive gyms (Vancouver, North Shore, and the newly-opened Surrey location). 

This year I participated as part of team Bishi Bashi with Yvonne and 3 others [^1].  Being a big nerd, I decided to take a closer look at the competition scores, which were released on the [Hive's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/1809792565734658/posts/2463567067023868/).

# How the league works

Pacific Boulder League is a friendly team-based bouldering competition that includes all three Hive Bouldering gyms (Vancouver, North Shore, Surrey). Teams try to climb the hardest boulders they can and accumulate points throughout 5 weeks + one finals week. 

First, I was really interested in seeing how teams ranked compared to all teams in the competition (from all gyms). 

Let's take a look at the teams that ended up in the top 10 by the end of the competition:

```{r}
rank_plot <- function(data, expand = 1.5) {
  data %>% 
    
    # remove missing scores
    ungroup %>%
    filter(!is.na(rank_weekly_cum)) %>% 
    
    {
    ggplot(data = .,
           aes(x = week, y = rank_weekly_cum, color = team_name)) +
      
      # basics
      geom_line(aes(group = team_name),size = 1.75, alpha = 0.5) +
      geom_point(size = 9) +
      geom_text(aes(label = rank_weekly_cum), color = 'white', size = 4) +
      
      
      # labels for left and right of lines
      geom_text(data =  . %>% filter(week == 1),
                aes(label = team_name, x = min(.$week)-0.6, color = team_name) , 
                hjust = 'right', nudge_x = 0.1, size = 5) +
      geom_text(data =  . %>% filter(week == 6),
                aes(label = team_name, x = max(.$week)-0.6, color = team_name) , 
                hjust = 'left', nudge_x = 1, size = 5) +
        
      theme_bw(base_size = 12)+
      scale_y_reverse(breaks = 1:max(.$rank_weekly_cum)) +
      scale_x_continuous(expand = c(expand,0.4), breaks = 1:6,
                         labels = c(1:5, 'Finals')) +
      scale_color_viridis_d() +
      theme_bw(base_size = fontsize + 1) +
      theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
            panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
            panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
            panel.border = element_blank(),
            axis.ticks = element_blank(),
            legend.position = '') +
      labs(x = 'Week', y = 'Rank', 
           title = 'Teams weekly ranking', 
           subtitle = 'across all gyms')}
  }

rank_data <- pbl_all %>%
  # calculate rank based on cumulative score
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(week = as.numeric(as.factor(week)),
         team_name = fct_rev(fct_reorder(team_name, score, sum, na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
  
  
  group_by(week) %>%
  mutate(rank_weekly_cum = row_number(desc(score_cum)))  %>%
  select(team_name, week, rank_weekly_cum) %>%
  group_by(team_name) 

fh <- 10
fw <- 9
```


```{r, fig.height=fh, fig.width=fw}
rank_data %>%
  filter(any(week == 6 & rank_weekly_cum %in% 1:10)) %>%
  rank_plot(expand = 0.5)
```

There's some interesting things going on here:[^7]

* The top 3 teams were consistently in the lead the entire competition
* There's some more variation in rankings in the top 4-10 teams:
  - Teams *Jako* and *Crimp My Ride* had rough starts (bottom 60%) but dramatically overtook other teams by the end of the competition.
  
*Why did these two teams start off so low in the rankings?* I can only speculate since I don't know who was on those teams. Did some members miss the first week or two? I remember there was a cold going around at that time, maybe some got sick?

Also notice that the team in rank 2 during week 1 is missing from the graph. That means that this team did not end up in the final top 10. So who is this team and where did they end up in the rankings? 

Let's see if we can find this team. 

Here are those teams that placed in 11-20:

```{r, fig.height=fh*1.3, fig.width=fw}
rank_data %>%
  filter(any(week == 6 & rank_weekly_cum %in% 11:20)) %>%
  rank_plot()
```


The team that was in 2nd for week 1 was team  *Generic Bouldering Team Name*. Then, they were in 5th place before finals, before placing 17th after finals. Wow, that's a dramatic drop! 

I actually know the story of this team. Turns out, one member got injured on week 3 (or 4?) and had to drop out. Also, I think some of their other members were also unable to attend the finals. Unfortunate, because it seems like this team could have done really well.  


Another team showed the opposite trend. Team *Jugs Not Drugs* started in 34th position (4th last), *crawled* to 26th position before finals, and ended up in 19th after finals. 

These teams that I pointed out all had steady decreases / increases in their ranking throughout the competition. But, there were also some teams that had consistent performance (their weekly ranking was relatively constant), before drammatically increasing or decreasing their ranking after the finals week:

## Teams that placed 21-30

```{r, fig.height=fh*1.2, fig.width=fw}
rank_data %>%
  filter(any(week == 6 & rank_weekly_cum %in% 21:30)) %>%
  rank_plot(expand = 1)
```

Teams *Aaron Lacovitti* and *Soft Rock* had relatively stable weekly rankings, but both showed dramatic drops after finals (7 to 24, 8 to 25, respectively). Some other teams (*Between the Chalks*, *The Rumble*) showed the opposite (an increase after finals). 

What's going on here? 

Well, the PBL Hive Finals had an interesting format. Scores for that week *counted for double points* and special *team problems for bonus points* were created. Scores from finals were then added on to the previous 5 weeks of scores to determine a final ranking/placement. The idea with these special rules was to allow teams an opportunity to drastically improve their ranking by performing better at finals than any other week. 

But! I expect that teams will on average perform just as well in finals as they did in any other week. After all, how much can you improve your bouldering level in the 1 week break before finals? Even though teams will get  more points during finals, we expect that their relative perforance between each team to be the same, and therefore their ranking to remain the same. For these reasons, the special scoring format cannot account for the dramatic changes in ranking between teams from finals.

Instead, I think the changes in ranking were simply because the finals was held on a single day: Friday, Nov 1st, 6-9PM. This is in contrast to previous weeks, where teams had the flexibility to choose any day and time to climb. So I think these dramatic changes in post-finals ranking is because some participants could simply not make it. 

Before I explore that further, for completeness I wanted to show the teams that placed in the bottom 7:

## Teams that placed 31-37

```{r, fig.height=fh*1.35, fig.width=fw}
rank_data %>%
  filter(any(week == 6 & rank_weekly_cum %in% 31:37)) %>%
  rank_plot(expand = 0.5)

```

# Teams that missed weeks

OK, so I think that teams that had dramatic changes in their post-finals ranking are likely just teams that could not fully attend the finals. This is easy to check! But first, let me explain the rules around attendance, which are important to understand to interpret the data.

[PBL rules](https://hiveclimbing.com/events/) try to accomodate teams when there are weeks where some members are unable to attend:

1. Teams must climb together once a week, but can pick any day/time
2. A maximum of one team member can be absent for a given week, without any penalization on their scores

However, even with these accomodations, **some teams did not participate every week:**
```{r, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 5.5, fig.cap="Note: I interpret that when a team did not hand in their score, they simply were unable to get enough team members to meet at the same time that week."}
pbl_all %>%
  mutate(missing = is.na(score)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = team_name, fill = missing)) +
  geom_tile(colour = '#ffffff') +
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0,0), position = 'right') +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0,0), position = 'top') +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('TRUE' = '#88C837', 'FALSE' = '#00748B'),
                    labels = c('Yes', 'No'),
                    guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 1))) +
  facet_grid(gym~., scales = 'free', space= 'free', switch = 'y') +
  labs(fill = 'Handed in a score card?', y = '', x = '') +
  theme_bw(base_size = fontsize) +
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(hjust =0, vjust = 2),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        strip.background = element_blank(),
        strip.placement = "outside",
        strip.text.y = element_text(face = 'bold', angle = 180,
                                    vjust = 1.0,
                                    hjust = 1),
        legend.position = 'top',
        legend.direction = 'vertical')
```

**For the Hive finals week, 13 out of 39 teams (33%) teams did not hand in their score card**. This is much lower than the week 1-5 average attendance (>95%). This supports our line of thinking that probably a lot of those teams that had dramatic drops in post-finals ranking are likely teams that could not attend[^2] [^3]. 

Some other observations:

- Team *Vol. U & Me* dropped out after the first week
- *Veloci-rock-tors* and *One Hex Flex* were the only other teams that missed non-finals weeks.

Next, I wanted to compare last year's competition to this year's.

# 2019 versus 2018 

Last year, Yvonne (also a big nerd) kept track of all the team's scores from the Vancouver location[^4]. One thing was clearly different from last year: **attendance.**

**There were 39 teams across all three gyms this year, compared to 19 teams from last year.** That's more than double the attendance!

Most of this increase in number of teams occured in the Vancouver gym (14 -> 24). Surrey actually had more teams participating than North Shore (8 versus 7), which is surprising, given that Surrey only opened earlier this year. 

```{r, warning = FALSE}
pbl_all %>%
  filter(week == '1') %>%
  count(gym) %>%
  mutate(year = 2019) %>%
  bind_rows(data.frame(gym = c('North Shore', 'Vancouver'),
                       n = c(5, 14),
                       year = 2018)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, fill = gym)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(label =n, group = gym, y = n-2), color = 'white', size = 8) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(begin = b, end = e, direction = 1,
                        guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 4))) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2018, 2019), labels = scales::number) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(gym), scales = 'free_x', space = 'free') +
  theme_bw(base_size = fontsize + 2) +
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        strip.background = element_blank(),
        strip.text = element_text(face = 'bold'),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())
```

Since there was an increase in number of teams from last year, I wondered if this increase was due to more interest in climbing and participation among **beginner** climbers. This would make sense, because a large proportion of the increase in teams occured at the new Surrey location (*new gyms = new climbers?*). 

**To determine if the increase in PBL attendance from 2018 to 2019 were due to beginner climbers joining,** I looked at if teams from 2018 scored higher than 2019 teams [^5]. 

The plot below is a *density* plot of weekly team scores, for each gym, and for each year. The height of the *peaks* is proportional to how many teams reported that score (x-axis).

```{r}
pbl_year <- pbl_2018 %>%
  dplyr::rename(team_name = Teams) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(-team_name, -Total),
               names_to = 'week',
               values_to = 'score') %>%
  mutate(score_hex = score/5,
         year = 2018,
         gym = 'Vancouver') %>%
  bind_rows(pbl_all %>% mutate(year =2019)) %>%
  filter(week != 'final',
         score_hex > 1,
         !is.na(score_hex)) %>%
  mutate(year = factor(year, levels = c('2019', '2018')))

pbl_year %>%
  mutate(gym = fct_relevel(gym, c('Vancouver', 'Surrey', 'North Shore'))) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_density_ridges(aes(y = gym, x = score_hex, fill = gym), 
                      color = NA,alpha = 1,
                      panel_scaling = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(begin = b, end = e, direction = -1,
                        guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1,
                                                                 color = NA),
                                             reverse = TRUE)) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(year), scales = 'free', switch = 'y', space = 'free')+
  labs(title = 'Average weekly hex scores',
       subtitle = 'between 2018 and 2019 PBL teams',
       x = '') +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(), 
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        strip.background = element_blank(),
        strip.text.y = element_text(face = 'bold', angle = 180, 
                                    hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 6)) 

```

```{r eval = FALSE}
pbl_year %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(score_hex))

pbl_year %>%
  mutate(gym_year = paste0(gym, '_', year) %>%
           as_factor() %>%
           fct_relevel(c('Vancouver_2018'))) %>%
  lm(score_hex ~ gym_year, data = .) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(FDR = p.adjust(p.value, method = 'fdr'),
         bonf = p.adjust(p.value, method = 'bonferroni'),
         p.value = scales::number(p.value, accuracy = 0.01))
```

**Did teams perform better this year compared to last?**

On average, no... teams this year reported lower scores (average 2019 weekly hex score = 3.09) compared to last year (3.23), **but this decrease in performance was not statistically significant (p<0.05)[^6].** 

So, **the increase in attendance this year was not because of mainly new climbers deciding to join. Teams that joined this year consisted of climbers with varied skill level.** 

*Then, why did attendance increase so dramatically this year?* One explanation could be that advertisement for PBL was much better at the Hive this year. In general, I've noticed the Hive Vancouver has been really on top of their events chalkboard and email news letters. Increase in attendance could also be a sign that last year's season was a great success.

# Were some weeks harder than others? {.tabset}

I definitely thought the second and third week of PBL was really easy for our team. It seemed like we were climbing problems that were rated as very difficult, but felt not actually that difficult. I wonder if other teams felt the same?

Before we can tackle that question, we first have to make an assumption: climbers skill levels stay constant throughout the competition. But I think this is a reasonable assumption, because 6 weeks is a short amount of time to make noticeable improvements in climbing ability.

Given the above assumption, we can attribute the observed variation in weekly team scores can be primarily attributed to variation in route setting difficulty (i.e. how difficult the problems are graded/rated by the organizers)[^variation]


If more teams performed better than average for a given week, that means that the boulders that were set that week were easier. If more teams performed worse, then boulders were harder that week.

To determine if some weeks were harder than others, I looked at the percentage of teams that scored better than their overall average performance throughout the whole competition:

```{r}
pbl_all_center <- pbl_all %>%
  filter(week != 'final') %>%
  group_by(team_name) %>%
  mutate(score_centered = score - mean(score, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  select(team_name, gym, week, score, score_centered) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(gym, week, score_centered) %>%
  mutate(order = row_number(),
         week = factor(if_else(week == '1', 'Week 1', week),
                       levels = c('Week 1', '2', '3', '4', '5'))) %>%
  filter(!is.na(score_centered)) 

colors <- setNames(viridisLite::viridis(begin = b, end = e, n = 3, direction = 1),
                   levels(pbl_all$gym))

plot_center_bar <- function(data) {
  data %>% 
    group_by(gym, week) %>%
    summarize(p_pos = sum(score_centered > 0)/length(score_centered),
              p_neg = 1-p_pos) %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = contains('p_'),
                 names_to = 'direction',
                 names_prefix = 'p_',
                 values_to = 'p') %>%
    mutate(ymin = if_else(direction == 'pos', 0, 1-p),
           ymax = if_else(direction == 'pos', p, 1),
           week_num = as.numeric(week)) %>%
    filter(direction == 'pos') %>%
    {
      ggplot(data = ., aes(x = week)) +
        geom_bar(aes(y = p, alpha = direction, fill = gym), 
                 stat = 'identity',
                 width = 1, 
                 color = 'white') +
        geom_text(data = filter(., direction == 'pos'),
                  size = 7,
                  aes(y = p, label = scales::percent(p, accuracy = 1)),
                  nudge_y = +0.1,
                  color = 'black') +
        facet_grid(rows = vars(gym), switch = 'y') +
        scale_fill_manual(values = colors, 
                          guide = FALSE) +
        scale_alpha_manual(name = 'Relative\nperfromance',
                           labels = c('Worse', 'Better'),
                           values = c('pos' = 1, 'neg' = 0.25),
                           guide = FALSE) +
        scale_x_discrete(position = 'bottom') +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL, limits = c(0,1.1)) +
        theme(panel.border = element_blank(),

              axis.ticks = element_blank(),
              axis.title = element_blank(),

              strip.background = element_blank(),
              strip.text.y  = element_text(angle = 180, face = 'bold')) +
        labs(fill = '', title = 'Percentage of teams that performed better', 
             subtitle = 'compared to their average weekly score')
    }
}

fh <- 8.5
fw <- 7.5
```

```{r, fig.width = fw, fig.height = fh}
pbl_all_center %>%
#  filter(gym == 'Vancouver') %>%
  plot_center_bar()

fh <- 8
fw <- 9
```

* **The first week's problems were hard!** All gyms had more teams performing relatively worse than average (% of teams performing better than average was < 30%).
* At Vancouver, the 3rd and 4th week were easier than usual - 78 and 91% of teams performed better than average for those weeks, respectively.
* At Surrey, the first two weeks were harder than the last 3 weeks (25-38% vs 62-75%).
* At North Shore, the first and last weeks were harder than the middle 3 (29% vs 57%).

**It would be interesting to further break this down by grade.** Our team found week 2 easy, but only 35% of Vancouver teams performed better than their average that week. This is likely because our team climbed at a different grade range than most other teams. Problems that we were trying that week might have been easier, but at the same time, problems in other grade ranges could have been much harder.

# Conclusion

That's it for now! I looked at this data in a couple of other ways, but I wanted to par this post down to a few interesting points. Making this post was a lot of fun, and I hope to continue looking at climbing data in future ones. With respect to PBL, this season was a lot of fun. I was really impressed with the turnout this year, and happy that our team did so well. I hope to see the Hive continuing thinking about how to improve PBL for future seasons.

[^variation]: Of course, there are many factors that can affect *individual* teams' weekly performance (e.g. injuries, absences). But, not many factors can explain large systematic changes in performance across *all* teams.
[^1]: We had new team members this year (Me, and Robbie C). Unfortunately Dan B. betrayed us this year and joined another's team (just kidding, Dan `r emo::ji("smile")`).
[^2]: Some teams had only a few members that were present at the finals.
[^3]: This was certainly the most busiest day of the year for me. I had to attend Medical Genetics Research Day at UBC all day until ~6PM. Then I had to drive home to feed Sandy. I didn't actually even get to the finals until around 8PM. Oh and also it was my birthday `r emo::ji('birthday')`!
[^4]: Yvonne only kept track of Vancouver scores from 2018. The North Shore had teams as well. The Surrey gym did not exist last year.
[^5]: Last year I did not participate because of a chronic finger injury, which I'm happy to report has almost fully healed (continuing)
[^6]: p-value > 0.05, linear modelling.

# About Me

Hi I'm Victor, I'm a bioinformatics scientist working at Sonoma Biotherapeutics
in San Francisco. I work with RNAseq data a lot, sometimes I dabble in other 
-omics data. I like to build web apps in Rshiny and thinking about data 
workflows. 

In my spare time I like to rock climb, spend time with my espresso machine, and
make food for loved ones.

# About Me

Hi I'm Victor, 

I'm a Bioinformatics Scientist based in San Francisco working at [Sonoma 
Biotherapeutics](https://sonomabio.com/), where we are developing cell based immune therapies to treat autoimmune disease. My day-to-day work involves close collaboration with other scientist to answer scientific questions by 
processing and analyzing large biological datasets. 

On the side, I enjoy learning and [building web apps in rshiny](https://www.victoryuan.com/rbiotechsalary/). I am open to working for free for causes that I align with.

When I'm not working, I like to climb rocks :rock:, spend time with my espresso machine :coffee:, and
make food for loved ones :heart: :ramen: :family:.

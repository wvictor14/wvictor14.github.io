For the 2025 plotnine contest, I wanted to explore official Canadian labour statistics using Plotnine, a visualization library that brings the powerful Grammar of Graphics framework to Python.

Using quarto, I created a website, which hosts the [final submitted visualization](https://victoryuan.com/labourcan/), and a [tutorial](https://victoryuan.com/labourcan/02_develop_visualization.html) on how I developed the visualization.

The visualization uses the plotnine, which is a visualization library from python, heavily inspired by the grammar of graphics. I used `polars` to crunch the data.

On August 21 2025, Posit announced the [2025 Table and Plotnine contests](https://posit.co/blog/announcing-the-2025-table-and-plotnine-contests/). I was always impressed with the resulting submissions from previous years, so this year I decided to participate.

Initially, I decided that the `plotnine` contest sounded like a great opportunity to see how to use the python port of `ggplot2`. I had no experience with plotnine, but lots with ggplot2.

However, after finishing my submission for `plotnine`, I turned my attention to the table contest. I wasn't certain if I had the time to make another high quality submission. But I felt that I had a great idea that I haven't seen done before. So I reconsidered and decided to make a smaller single post entry for the table contest. 

# Exploring Canada Job Market Data with `plotnine`

For the 2025 plotnine contest, I wanted to explore official Canadian labour statistics using Plotnine.

Using quarto, I created a website, which hosts the [final submitted visualization](https://victoryuan.com/labourcan/), and a [tutorial](https://victoryuan.com/labourcan/02_develop_visualization.html) on how I developed the visualization.

The visualization uses the plotnine, which is a visualization library from python, heavily inspired by the grammar of graphics. I used `polars` to crunch the data.

# Coronavirus Spike Proteins with `r-gt`

For the 2025 Posit Table contest I wanted to explore how MSAs can be effectively visualized using the r package gt. This has been something I have wanted to do for a long time, and felt like this would be great way to share some of the exploration with the community.

Or something like that."

    "section": "How",
    "text": "How\n\nGithub Actions\nI followed this post closely to learn how to make my own workflow. Essentially it uses github actions to run an R script in the github repository on a daily basis (a cron job).\nThis is the section that configures the cron job. I also set it up so that on a certain branch named “test”, the script will run. I use this for testing that the workflow works, without having to change the cron schedule everytime.\non:\n  push:\n    branches: ['test'] # push to this branch to test toots\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '41 15 * * *'  # trigger at 3pm UTC  every day\nThe other necessary component is to add mastdon API token to github repository as a “github secret”. Then in the workflow, the token is used with the following syntax:\n${{ secrets.RTOOT_DEFAULT_TOKEN}}\n\n\nYay for open source\nThe last component is making the R script to: pull data, identify NEW vacancies, create a tweet / toot to send.\nI pulled data from BC gov’s open data portal, and figured out a way to ID new vacancies. Then, a message is crafted accounting for the character limits (500) for mastodon toots.\nActually the character limit is quite restrictive. Every day there can be 50-150 new vacancies over BC, depending on child care age group. But we only have 1 child (thank) so currently the bot only reports facilities with vacancy for children aged &lt;36 months.\nEvery day this dataset is updated at this URL. The whole script depends on whether this URL stays the same. If it changes, the bot will stop working. Fingers crossed!"

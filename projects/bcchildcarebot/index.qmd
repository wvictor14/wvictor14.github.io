This project leverages publicly available Government of BC's Child Care Vacancies to identify and disseminate up-to-date child care vacancy across the province.

The system is implemented as an automated data pipeline that ingests a publicly available open data endpoint that refreshes daily, processes vacancy information, and distributes results through two public-facing channels:


1. An interactive web dashboard that allows users to browse current vacancies in a centralized, accessible format.

2. Automated social media reporting via a Mastodon bot that posts newly available child care vacancies.

::: {.callout-note}
Note the Mastodon bot has been decommisioned due to the [closure of the `bots.in.space` server in 2025](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41989511). At this time, I have not yet looked for alternative hosting options.

The goal of this project was to deliver these resources while minimizing overhead and maintenance, ensuring longevity without overburdening operations.

The pipeline is orchestrated using GitHub Actions, enabling scheduled data retrieval, validation, transformation, and deployment without manual intervention. This ensures that published information remains current, reliable, and reproducible.

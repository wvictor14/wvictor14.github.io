This project leverages salary survey data collected from Reddit’s [r/biotech](https://www.reddit.com/r/biotech/comments/1i1rgxm/rbiotech_salary_and_company_survey_2025/) community to explore compensation trends in biotechnology. Initially, I used this data to inform my own job search as a new graduate, but over time it became a foundation for exploring data cleaning, visualization, and interactive data science techniques.

# Data Pipeline

The survey responses are collected via a Google Form, stored in a live Google Sheet, and automatically pulled weekly using GitHub Actions. An ETL pipeline (Quarto Markdown script) cleans, validates, and publishes the dataset as a flat CSV file on GitHub:

[Published dataset (CSV) *updates daily](https://github.com/wvictor14/rbiotechsalarydata/blob/main/salary_results_cleaned.csv)

# Interactive Applications

To explore and visualize the data, I developed a Shiny app deployed as a Docker container on a Digital Ocean droplet. The app reads the cleaned dataset directly from GitHub and provides:

- Interactive filters for examining salary distributions, experience, and other survey responses.
- Visualizations that allow users to explore trends by role, company type, or other factors.

This setup ensures that the dataset remains up-to-date, reproducible, and transparent while requiring minimal manual intervention.

Additionally, I have explored Observable JS dashboards as an alternative approach for interactive data exploration:

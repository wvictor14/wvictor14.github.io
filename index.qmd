This is me, for a large portion of my day, I am **Bioinformatics Scientist**, meaning that my job means to understand biological data through programming, statistics, and scientific methods.

Outside of my day-job however, I like to sometimes explore other parts of my life, my interests, through the lens of a data scientist. Sometimes I like to explore tools and methods that are not necessarily directly related to my dayjob, in an environment without any pressures related to work.

And on rare occasions, my explorations result in content that I find to reach an acceptable standard that I'm comfortable with making public. So welcome, this is where I decided that content lives - I hope some of the things I have worked on will be helpful to others.

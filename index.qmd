This is me, I am a **Bioinformatics Scientist** working at a Cell Therapy company. On very special occasions, I somehow gather inspiration and motivation to write about things that interest me. And then, even more infrequently, do I decide that my content is good enough to publish. Stand back and revel, at my littered path of breadcrumbs.

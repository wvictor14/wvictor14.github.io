I am a **Bioinformatics Scientist**, meaning that my job is to understand biological data through the usage of programming, statistics, and scientific methods.

I started this website initially for several reasons - like I have been interested in having a space to explore computational tools, or have wanted to create some of an online presence to increase my employability.

That still remains mostly true. However, I find that after spending most of my day thinking and working on bioinformatics and clinical data, I prefer spending my spare time thinking about other things. So there is mostly content unrelated to bioinformatics here, but a lot of the tools that I cover are relevant to any data-related work.

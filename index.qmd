Hello, I'm Victor, and welcome to my website!

I am a  **data scientist** at [Sonoma Biotherapeutics](https://sonomabio.com/). I spend my time translating complex biological data into data-driven stories that help us understand how to better develop cell therapies to treat autoimmune diseases.

<!--- Professional stack --->

What I do:

- Data Visualization: Crafting beautiful charts and effective visual narratives.
- Pipeline Engineering: Building automated, reproducible systems for scientific computing.
- Tool Development: Writing software that makes scientific data analysis more accessible.

<!--- Background --->
I earned my PhD from the **University of British Columbia (2022), Vancouver BC**, focusing on epigenetics and placental biology, following a **BSc in Molecular Biology from Concordia University, Montreal QC**.

<!--- Beyond the Data --->
When I’m off the clock, you’ll likely find me at a rock climbing gym, hunting for the perfect pour-over, or criticizing car-centric urban development and transit systems in North America.

*I’m always keen to connect with others in the biotech and data science space. If you’re working on an interesting problem and need a fresh perspective, feel free to reach out!* <a href="mailto:victorwyuan@gmail.com" style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: 10px;">

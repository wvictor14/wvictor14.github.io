Hello! It's nice to meet you. I am a  **bioinformatics data scientist** at [Sonoma Biotherapeutics](https://sonomabio.com/) where I use data science to help develop cell therapies to cure autoimmune diseases. I love making beautiful charts, developing reproducible scientific content, climbing boulders, and drinking specialty coffees.

I studied epigenetics and placental biology, completing my PhD at University of British Columbia, Canada in 2022. Before that I did my BSc in molecular biology at Concordia University, Montreal.
